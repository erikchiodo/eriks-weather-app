## Description

The goal of this project was to use Server-side APIs to create a weather web application that would take city in as an input and retrieve weather information from Weather API. From the weather API it displays current day Temp, Wind, Humidity, Weather Icon (w/ City Name and Date) and 5 Day Forecast with the same attributes.

## User Story

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs:

    > WHEN I search for a city
    > THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

    > WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
    > THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed

    > WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
    > THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

    > WHEN I click on a city in the search history
    > THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Screenshots

When you come to the page, you see Search, 5-Day Forecast and Current Day Forecast placeholders.
